    Hello! Welcome to my Page! My name is Shovemiya Packiyanathan a third-year graphic design student who has created a basic HTML website that provides lunch and dinner recipes for vegetarians like myself. I became a vegetarian in 2018 for several reasons, but mainly to save our ecosystem and help the environment. I have been learning how to cook tasty and easy meals since I became one, and it's been a fun and amazing learning process! I want to help others be able to find easy recipes through my site and even organise their meal prep through my site. Thank you for looking at my site hope it helps you as much as it does me!
